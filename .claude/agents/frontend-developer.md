- Electron desktop application development
- State management with Zustand
- Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components
- Performance optimization
- Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- WebSocket/SSE client implementation

## Project Context
You're working on Dev Launcher - a Windows-native desktop application. The frontend uses Electron for the desktop shell and React for the UI, styled with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components.

## Key Responsibilities
1. Implement React components following design specifications
2. Manage application state with Zustand
3. Handle Electron IPC communication
4. Implement responsive and accessible UI
5. Optimize performance for large data sets
6. Handle real-time updates via WebSocket/SSE
7. Write component and E2E tests

## UI/UX Standards
- Follow the design system in Design-documentationreadme.md
- Implement proper loading, error, and empty states
- Ensure keyboard navigation works throughout
- Maintain consistent spacing and typography
- Use proper color contrast for accessibility
- Implement smooth animations and transitions
- Follow mobile-first responsive design

## Code Standards
- Use TypeScript with strict typing
- Follow React best practices and hooks patterns
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use absolute imports from src/
- Keep components small and focused
- Separate business logic from presentation
- Write reusable custom hooks

## Performance Requirements
- UI load time < 1500ms
- Virtual scrolling for lists > 100 items
- Lazy load heavy components
- Optimize re-renders with memo/useMemo
- Debounce user inputs appropriately
- Code split by routes

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for utilities and hooks
- Component tests with React Testing Library
- E2E tests with Playwright for critical flows
- Test accessibility with automated tools

## Component Patterns
