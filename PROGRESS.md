## üìù Detailed Progress Log

### 2025-08-10 - Initial Setup

#### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks
1. **Documentation Analysis**
   - Analyzed Anthropic's sub-agents documentation
   - Analyzed Claude Code best practices
   - Reviewed all existing project documentation (PRD, Architecture, Backend, Frontend, DevOps specs)

2. **Project Configuration**
   - Created CLAUDE.md with comprehensive project guidelines
   - Established coding standards and conventions
   - Defined API design principles
   - Set performance targets and security guidelines

3. **Sub-agents Setup**
   - Created backend-developer agent for API and services implementation
   - Created frontend-developer agent for React/Electron development
   - Created docker-specialist agent for containerization
   - Created test-engineer agent for comprehensive testing
   - Created devops-engineer agent for CI/CD and operations

4. **Progress Tracking**
   - Initialized PROGRESS.md for development tracking
   - Set up phase-based development approach

#### üöß In Progress
- Testing and debugging the complete application
- Setting up installation scripts
- Preparing for first release

#### üìã Next Steps
1. Complete React component implementation
2. Create project templates (blank, Next.js, WordPress)
3. Add authentication and CSRF protection
4. Implement CLI tool installation services
5. Add WebSocket/SSE for real-time updates
6. Write tests for critical components

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decisions

### Confirmed Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js + TypeScript + Express + Prisma + SQLite
- **Frontend**: Electron + React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- **State**: Zustand for React state management
- **Testing**: Vitest/Jest + Playwright
- **Logging**: Pino (NDJSON format)
- **Container**: All components run in Docker

### Key Patterns
- RESTful API with consistent error handling
- Zod validation for all inputs
- Service-based architecture for backend
- Component-based architecture for frontend
- All-in-Docker deployment strategy

## üîÑ Daily Updates

### 2025-08-10
**Focus**: Initial setup and architecture planning
**Completed**: 
- Documentation analysis (PRD, Architecture, Backend, Frontend specs)
- Created CLAUDE.md with comprehensive project guidelines
- Set up 5 specialized sub-agents
- Initialized Node.js project with TypeScript
- Created Prisma database schema with SQLite
- Docker configuration (Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml)
- Complete backend API implementation:
  - Express server with all middleware
  - All API endpoints (projects, tasks, ports, settings, audit)
  - Docker service with full orchestration
  - Port allocator with collision detection
  - Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Electron shell setup with IPC communication
- React application structure with routing

## üìå Important Notes

1. **All-in-Docker Architecture**: Every component must run in containers
2. **Location Support**: Must support both WSL and Windows project locations
3. **Port Management**: Dynamic allocation with collision detection is critical
4. **Performance**: WSL bind mounts recommended for Docker projects
5. **Security**: API must be loopback-only with proper authentication
